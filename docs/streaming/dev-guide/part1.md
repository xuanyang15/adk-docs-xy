# ADK Bidi-streaming development guide: Part 1 - Introduction

Welcome to the world of bidirectional streaming with [Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/). This article will transform your understanding of AI agent communication from traditional request-response patterns to dynamic, real-time conversations that feel as natural as talking to another person.

Imagine building an AI assistant that doesn't just wait for you to finish speaking before responding, but actively listens and can be interrupted mid-sentence when you have a sudden thought. Picture creating customer support bots that handle audio, video, and text simultaneously while maintaining context throughout the conversation. This is the power of bidirectional streaming, and ADK makes it accessible to every developer.

## 1.1 What is Bidi-streaming?

Bidi-streaming (Bidirectional streaming) represents a fundamental shift from traditional AI interactions. Instead of the rigid "ask-and-wait" pattern, it enables **real-time, two-way communication** where both human and AI can speak, listen, and respond simultaneously. This creates natural, human-like conversations with immediate responses and the revolutionary ability to interrupt ongoing interactions.

Think of the difference between sending emails and having a phone conversation. Traditional AI interactions are like emails—you send a complete message, wait for a complete response, then send another complete message. Bidirectional streaming is like a phone conversation—fluid, natural, with the ability to interrupt, clarify, and respond in real-time.

### Key Characteristics

These characteristics distinguish bidirectional streaming from traditional AI interactions and make it uniquely powerful for creating engaging user experiences:

- **Two-way Communication**: Continuous data exchange without waiting for complete responses. Either the user and AI can start responding to the first few words of your question while you're still speaking, creating an experience that feels genuinely conversational rather than transactional.

- **Responsive Interruption**: Perhaps the most important feature for the natural user experience—users can interrupt the agent mid-response with new input, just like in human conversation. If an AI is explaining quantum physics and you suddenly ask "wait, what's an electron?", the AI stops immediately and addresses your question.

- **Best for Multimodal**: Simultaneous support for text, audio, and video inputs creates rich, natural interactions. Users can speak while showing documents, type follow-up questions during voice calls, or seamlessly switch between communication modes without losing context.

    Agent->>Client: "Hello!"
    Agent->>Client: "Sure! Japan's history is a..." (partial content)
    Client->>Agent: "Ah, wait."

    Agent->>Client: "OK, how can I help?" (interrupted = True)
```

### Difference from Other Streaming Types

Understanding how bidirectional streaming differs from other approaches is crucial for appreciating its unique value. The streaming landscape includes several distinct patterns, each serving different use cases:

!!! info "Streaming Types Comparison"

    **Bidi-streaming** differs fundamentally from other streaming approaches:

    - **Server-Side Streaming**: One-way data flow from server to client. Like watching a live video stream—you receive continuous data but can't interact with it in real-time. Useful for dashboards or live feeds, but not for conversations.

    - **Token-Level Streaming**: Sequential text token delivery without interruption. The AI generates response word-by-word, but you must wait for completion before sending new input. Like watching someone type a message in real-time—you see it forming, but can't interrupt.

    - **Bidirectional Streaming**: Full two-way communication with interruption support. True conversational AI where both parties can speak, listen, and respond simultaneously. This is what enables natural dialogue where you can interrupt, clarify, or change topics mid-conversation.

### Real-World Applications

Bidirectional streaming revolutionizes agentic AI applications by enabling agents to operate with human-like responsiveness and intelligence. These applications showcase how streaming transforms static AI interactions into dynamic, agent-driven experiences that feel genuinely intelligent and proactive.

In a video of the [Shopper's Concierge demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwHPYyw7u6U), the multimodal, bi-directional streaming feature significantly improve the user experience of e-commerce by enabling a faster and more intuitive shopping experience. The combination of conversational understanding and rapid, parallelized searching culminates in advanced capabilities like virtual try-on, boosting buyer confidence and reducing the friction of online shopping.

Also, you can think of many possible real-world applications for bidirectional streaming:

1. **Customer Service & Contact Centers**: This is the most direct application. The technology can create sophisticated virtual agents that go far beyond traditional chatbots.

    - **Use case**: A customer calls a retail company's support line about a defective product.
    - **Multimodality (video)**: The customer can say, "My coffee machine is leaking from the bottom, let me show you." They can then use their phone's camera to stream live video of the issue. The AI agent can use its vision capabilities to identify the model and the specific point of failure.
    - **Live Interaction & Interruption**: If the agent says, "Okay, I'm processing a return for your Model X coffee maker," the customer can interrupt with, "No, wait, it's the Model Y Pro," and the agent can immediately correct its course without restarting the conversation.

1. **Field Service & Technical Assistance**: Technicians working on-site can use a hands-free, voice-activated assistant to get real-time help.

    - **Use Case**: An HVAC technician is on-site trying to diagnose a complex commercial air conditioning unit.
    - **Multimodality (Video & Voice)**: The technician, wearing smart glasses or using a phone, can stream their point-of-view to the AI agent. They can ask, "I'm hearing a strange noise from this compressor. Can you identify it and pull up the diagnostic flowchart for this model?"
    - **Live Interaction**: The agent can guide the technician step-by-step, and the technician can ask clarifying questions or interrupt at any point without taking their hands off their tools.

1. **Healthcare & Telemedicine**: The agent can serve as a first point of contact for patient intake, triage, and basic consultations.

    - **Use Case**: A patient uses a provider's app for a preliminary consultation about a skin condition.
    - **Multimodality (Video/Image)**: The patient can securely share a live video or high-resolution image of a rash. The AI can perform a preliminary analysis and ask clarifying questions.

1. **Financial Services & Wealth Management**: An agent can provide clients with a secure, interactive, and data-rich way to manage their finances.

    - **Use Case**: A client wants to review their investment portfolio and discuss market trends.
    - **Multimodality (Screen Sharing)**: The agent can share its screen to display charts, graphs, and portfolio performance data. The client could also share their screen to point to a specific news article and ask, "What is the potential impact of this event on my tech stocks?"
    - **Live Interaction**: Analyze the client's current portfolio allocation by accessing their account data.Simulate the impact of a potential trade on the portfolio's risk profile.

## 1.2 ADK Bidi-streaming Architecture Overview

ADK Bidi-streaming architecture enables bidirectional AI conversations feel as natural as human dialogue. The architecture seamlessly integrates with Google's [Gemini Live API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/live) through a sophisticated pipeline that has been designed for low latency and high-throughput communication.

The system handles the complex orchestration required for real-time streaming—managing multiple concurrent data flows, handling interruptions gracefully, processing multimodal inputs simultaneously, and maintaining conversation state across dynamic interactions. ADK Bidi-streaming abstracts this complexity into simple, intuitive APIs that developers can use without needing to understand the intricate details of streaming protocols or AI model communication patterns.

## 1.3 Live Session Resumption

Live session resumption is a powerful feature in ADK that enhances the robustness of streaming agents. It allows an agent to resume a live session after an unexpected disconnection, ensuring a seamless user experience without losing the conversation context.

### How it Works

When a live streaming session is active, the ADK maintains a `live_session_resumption_handle` within the `InvocationContext`. This handle is a unique identifier for the session. If the connection is dropped, the client can reconnect and provide this handle to the ADK. The ADK will then attempt to resume the session from where it left off.

The `BaseLlmFlow` in the ADK is responsible for managing the session resumption logic. When a new connection is established with a `live_session_resumption_handle`, the flow transparently reconnects to the session, so the model is unaware of the disconnection.

### Example: Handling Session Resumption in a Client Application

Here is a conceptual example of how a client application would handle live session resumption. The client would need to store the `live_session_resumption_handle` and use it to reconnect if the connection is lost.

```python
import asyncio
from google.adk.agents import LiveRequestQueue
from google.adk.runners import InMemoryRunner

# Assume 'agent' is a pre-configured ADK agent
# and 'run_live_session' is a function that runs the agent
# and returns the live_session_resumption_handle.

async def main():
    session_handle = None
    while True:
        try:
            # Attempt to connect or reconnect to the live session
            session_handle = await run_live_session(session_handle)
        except ConnectionError as e:
            print(f"Connection lost: {e}. Attempting to reconnect in 5 seconds...")
            await asyncio.sleep(5)
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
            break

async def run_live_session(resumption_handle: str | None):
    # This function would typically be part of your application's backend
    # that interacts with the ADK.
    runner = InMemoryRunner()
    live_request_queue = LiveRequestQueue()

    # If a resumption_handle is provided, set it in the invocation context
    # This is a conceptual representation. The actual implementation may vary.
    invocation_context = runner.get_invocation_context(
        agent=agent,
        live_request_queue=live_request_queue
    )
    invocation_context.live_session_resumption_handle = resumption_handle

    # Start the live session
    async for event in runner.run_live(invocation_context):
        # Process events from the agent
        print(event)

        # In a real application, you would extract the new handle
        # from the event and persist it.
        # new_handle = event.get_new_session_handle()
        # if new_handle:
        #     resumption_handle = new_handle

    return resumption_handle # In a real app, this would be the updated handle

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## 1.4 Setting Up Your Development Environment

Now that you understand the gist of ADK Bidi-streaming architecture and the value it provides, it's time to get hands-on experience. This section will prepare your development environment so you can start building the streaming agents and applications described in the previous sections.

By the end of this setup, you'll have everything needed to create the intelligent voice assistants, proactive customer support agents, and multi-agent collaboration platforms we've discussed. The setup process is straightforward—ADK handles the complex streaming infrastructure, so you can focus on building your agent's unique capabilities rather than wrestling with low-level streaming protocols.

### Installation Steps

#### 1. Create Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate virtual environment
# macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate
# Windows CMD:

python-dotenv>=1.0.0
```

Install all dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 3. Set SSL Certificate Path (macOS only)

```bash
# Required for proper SSL handling on macOS
export SSL_CERT_FILE=$(python -m certifi)
```

#### 4. Set Up API Keys

Choose your preferred platform for running agents:

=== "Google AI Studio"

    1. Get an API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)
    2. Create a `.env` file in your project root:

    ```env
    GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=FALSE
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
    ```

=== "Google Cloud Vertex AI"

    1. Set up [Google Cloud project](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/start/quickstarts/quickstart-multimodal#setup-gcp)
    2. Install and configure [gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/start/quickstarts/quickstart-multimodal#setup-local)
    3. Authenticate: `gcloud auth login`
    4. [Enable Vertex AI API](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=aiplatform.googleapis.com)
    5. Create a `.env` file in your project root:

    ```env
    GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=TRUE
    GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=your_actual_project_id
    GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=us-central1
    ```

#### 5. Create Environment Setup Script

We will create the validation script that will verify your installation:

```bash
# Create the directory structure
mkdir -p src/part1
```

Create `src/part1/1-3-1_environment_setup.py`:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
