# State: The Session's Scratchpad

Within each `Session` (our conversation thread), the **`state`** attribute acts like the agent's dedicated scratchpad for that specific interaction. While `session.events` holds the full history, `session.state` is where the agent stores and updates dynamic details needed *during* the conversation.

## What is `session.state`?

Conceptually, `session.state` is a collection (dictionary or Map) holding key-value pairs. It's designed for information the agent needs to recall or track to make the current conversation effective:

* **Personalize Interaction:** Remember user preferences mentioned earlier (e.g., `'user_preference_theme': 'dark'`).
* **Track Task Progress:** Keep tabs on steps in a multi-turn process (e.g., `'booking_step': 'confirm_payment'`).
* **Accumulate Information:** Build lists or summaries (e.g., `'shopping_cart_items': ['book', 'pen']`).
* **Make Informed Decisions:** Store flags or values influencing the next response (e.g., `'user_is_authenticated': True`).

### Key Characteristics of `State`

1. **Structure: Serializable Key-Value Pairs**

    * Data is stored as `key: value`.
    * **Keys:** Always strings (`str`). Use clear names (e.g., `'departure_city'`, `'user:language_preference'`).
    * **Values:** Must be **serializable**. This means they can be easily saved and loaded by the `SessionService`. Stick to basic types in the specific languages (Python/ Java) like strings, numbers, booleans, and simple lists or dictionaries containing *only* these basic types. (See API documentation for precise details).
    * **⚠️ Avoid Complex Objects:** **Do not store non-serializable objects** (custom class instances, functions, connections, etc.) directly in the state. Store simple identifiers if needed, and retrieve the complex object elsewhere.

2. **Mutability: It Changes**

    * The contents of the `state` are expected to change as the conversation evolves.

3. **Persistence: Depends on `SessionService`**

    * Whether state survives application restarts depends on your chosen service:
      * `InMemorySessionService`: **Not Persistent.** State is lost on restart.
      * `DatabaseSessionService` / `VertexAiSessionService`: **Persistent.** State is saved reliably.

!!! Note
    The specific parameters or method names for the primitives may vary slightly by SDK language (e.g., `session.state['current_intent'] = 'book_flight'` in Python, `session.state().put("current_intent", "book_flight)` in Java). Refer to the language-specific API documentation for details.

### Organizing State with Prefixes: Scope Matters

Prefixes on state keys define their scope and persistence behavior, especially with persistent services:

* **No Prefix (Session State):**

    * **Scope:** Specific to the *current* session (`id`).
    * **Persistence:** Only persists if the `SessionService` is persistent (`Database`, `VertexAI`).
    * **Use Cases:** Tracking progress within the current task (e.g., `'current_booking_step'`), temporary flags for this interaction (e.g., `'needs_clarification'`).
    * **Example:** `session.state['current_intent'] = 'book_flight'`

* **`user:` Prefix (User State):**

    * **Scope:** Tied to the `user_id`, shared across *all* sessions for that user (within the same `app_name`).
    * **Persistence:** Persistent with `Database` or `VertexAI`. (Stored by `InMemory` but lost on restart).
    * **Use Cases:** User preferences (e.g., `'user:theme'`), profile details (e.g., `'user:name'`).
    * **Example:** `session.state['user:preferred_language'] = 'fr'`

* **`app:` Prefix (App State):**

    * **Scope:** Tied to the `app_name`, shared across *all* users and sessions for that application.
    * **Persistence:** Persistent with `Database` or `VertexAI`. (Stored by `InMemory` but lost on restart).
    * **Use Cases:** Global settings (e.g., `'app:api_endpoint'`), shared templates.
    * **Example:** `session.state['app:global_discount_code'] = 'SAVE10'`

* **`temp:` Prefix (Temporary Invocation State):**

    * **Scope:** Specific to the current **invocation** (the entire process from an agent receiving user input to generating the final output for that input).
    * **Persistence:** **Not Persistent.** Discarded after the invocation completes and does not carry over to the next one.
    * **Use Cases:** Storing intermediate calculations, flags, or data passed between tool calls within a single invocation.
    * **When Not to Use:** For information that must persist across different invocations, such as user preferences, conversation history summaries, or accumulated data.
    * **Example:** `session.state['temp:raw_api_response'] = {...}`

!!! note "Sub-Agents and Invocation Context"
    When a parent agent calls a sub-agent (e.g., using `SequentialAgent` or `ParallelAgent`), it passes its `InvocationContext` to the sub-agent. This means the entire chain of agent calls shares the same invocation ID and, therefore, the same `temp:` state.

**How the Agent Sees It:** Your agent code interacts with the *combined* state through the single `session.state` collection (dict/ Map). The `SessionService` handles fetching/merging state from the correct underlying storage based on prefixes.

### Accessing Session State in Agent Instructions

When working with `LlmAgent` instances, you can directly inject session state values into the agent's instruction string using a simple templating syntax. This allows you to create dynamic and context-aware instructions without relying solely on natural language directives.

#### Using `{key}` Templating

To inject a value from the session state, enclose the key of the desired state variable within curly braces: `{key}`. The framework will automatically replace this placeholder with the corresponding value from `session.state` before passing the instruction to the LLM.

**Example:**

```python
from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent

story_generator = LlmAgent(
    name="StoryGenerator",
    model="gemini-1.5-flash",
    instruction="""Write a short story about a cat, focusing on the theme: {topic}."""
)

# Assuming session.state['topic'] is set to "friendship", the LLM 
# will receive the following instruction:
# "Write a short story about a cat, focusing on the theme: friendship."
```

#### Important Considerations

* Key Existence: Ensure that the key you reference in the instruction string exists in the session.state. If the key is missing, the agent will throw an error. To use a key that may or may not be present, you can include a question mark (?) after the key (e.g. {topic?}).
* Data Types: The value associated with the key should be a string or a type that can be easily converted to a string.
* Escaping: To use literal curly braces in your instruction (e.g., `{{not a state variable}}`), you must double them up. If you need more complex logic, consider using an `InstructionProvider`.

#### Bypassing State Injection with `InstructionProvider`

In some cases, you might want to use `{{` and `}}` literally in your instructions without triggering the state injection mechanism. For example, you might be writing instructions for an agent that helps with a templating language that uses the same syntax.

To achieve this, you can provide a function to the `instruction` parameter instead of a string. This function is called an `InstructionProvider`. When you use an `InstructionProvider`, the ADK will not attempt to inject state, and your instruction string will be passed to the model as-is.

The `InstructionProvider` function receives a `ReadonlyContext` object, which you can use to access session state or other contextual information if you need to build the instruction dynamically.

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent
    from google.adk.agents.readonly_context import ReadonlyContext

    # This is an InstructionProvider
    def my_instruction_provider(context: ReadonlyContext) -> str:
        # You can optionally use the context to build the instruction
        # For this example, we'll return a static string with literal braces.
        return "This is an instruction with {{literal_braces}} that will not be replaced."

    agent = LlmAgent(
        model="gemini-1.5-flash",
        name="template_helper_agent",
        instruction=my_instruction_provider
    )
    ```

If you want to both use an `InstructionProvider` *and* inject state into your instructions, you can use the `inject_session_state` utility function.

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent
    from google.adk.agents.readonly_context import ReadonlyContext
    from google.adk.utils import instructions_utils

    async def my_dynamic_instruction_provider(context: ReadonlyContext) -> str:
        template = "This is a {adjective} instruction with {{literal_braces}}."
        # This will inject the 'adjective' state variable but leave the literal braces.
        return await instructions_utils.inject_session_state(template, context)

    agent = LlmAgent(
        model="gemini-1.5-flash",
        name="dynamic_template_helper_agent",
        instruction=my_dynamic_instruction_provider
    )
    ```

**Benefits of Direct Injection**

* Clarity: Makes it explicit which parts of the instruction are dynamic and based on session state.
* Reliability: Avoids relying on the LLM to correctly interpret natural language instructions to access state.
* Maintainability: Simplifies instruction strings and reduces the risk of errors when updating state variable names.

**Relation to Other State Access Methods**

This direct injection method is specific to LlmAgent instructions. Refer to the following section for more information on other state access methods.

### How State is Updated: Recommended Methods

!!! note "The Right Way to Modify State"
    When you need to change the session state, the correct and safest method is to **directly modify the `state` object on the `Context`** provided to your function (e.g., `callback_context.state['my_key'] = 'new_value'`). This is considered "direct state manipulation" in the right way, as the framework automatically tracks these changes.

    This is critically different from directly modifying the `state` on a `Session` object you retrieve from the `SessionService` (e.g., `my_session.state['my_key'] = 'new_value'`). **You should avoid this**, as it bypasses the ADK's event tracking and can lead to lost data. The "Warning" section at the end of this page has more details on this important distinction.

State should **always** be updated as part of adding an `Event` to the session history using `session_service.append_event()`. This ensures changes are tracked, persistence works correctly, and updates are thread-safe.

**1. The Easy Way: `output_key` (for Agent Text Responses)**

This is the simplest method for saving an agent's final text response directly into the state. When defining your `LlmAgent`, specify the `output_key`:

=== "Python"

    ```py
    from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent
    from google.adk.sessions import InMemorySessionService, Session
    from google.adk.runners import Runner
    from google.genai.types import Content, Part

    # Define agent with output_key
    greeting_agent = LlmAgent(
        name="Greeter",
        model="gemini-1.5-flash", # Use a valid model
        instruction="Generate a short, friendly greeting.",
        output_key="last_greeting" # Save response to state['last_greeting']
    )

    # --- Setup Runner and Session ---
    app_name, user_id, session_id = "state_app", "user1", "session1"
    session_service = InMemorySessionService()
    runner = Runner(
        agent=greeting_agent,
        app_name=app_name,
        session_service=session_service
    )
    session = await session_service.create_session(app_name=app_name,
                                        user_id=user_id,
                                        session_id=session_id)
    print(f"Initial state: {session.state}")

    # --- Run the Agent ---
    # Runner handles calling append_event, which uses the output_key
    # to automatically create the state_delta.
    user_message = Content(parts=[Part(text="Hello")])
    async for event in runner.run_async(user_id=user_id,
                                     session_id=session_id,
                                     new_message=user_message):
        if event.is_final_response():
          print(f"Agent responded.") # Response text is also in event.content

    # --- Check Updated State ---
    updated_session = await session_service.get_session(app_name=app_name, user_id=user_id, session_id=session_id)
    print(f"State after agent run: {updated_session.state}")
    # Expected output might include: {'last_greeting': 'Hello there! How can I help you today?'}
    ```

=== "Java"

    ```java
    --8<-- "examples/java/snippets/src/main/java/state/GreetingAgentExample.java:full_code"
    ```

Behind the scenes, the `Runner` uses the `output_key` to create the necessary `EventActions` with a `state_delta` and calls `append_event`.

**2. The Standard Way: `EventActions.state_delta` (for Complex Updates)**

For more complex scenarios (updating multiple keys, non-string values, specific scopes like `user:` or `app:`, or updates not tied directly to the agent's final text), you manually construct the `state_delta` within `EventActions`.

=== "Python"

    ```py
    from google.adk.sessions import InMemorySessionService, Session
    from google.adk.events import Event, EventActions
    from google.genai.types import Part, Content
    import time

    # --- Setup ---
    session_service = InMemorySessionService()
    app_name, user_id, session_id = "state_app_manual", "user2", "session2"
    session = await session_service.create_session(
        app_name=app_name,
        user_id=user_id,
        session_id=session_id,
        state={"user:login_count": 0, "task_status": "idle"}
    )
    print(f"Initial state: {session.state}")

    # --- Define State Changes ---
    current_time = time.time()
    state_changes = {
        "task_status": "active",              # Update session state
        "user:login_count": session.state.get("user:login_count", 0) + 1, # Update user state
        "user:last_login_ts": current_time,   # Add user state
        "temp:validation_needed": True        # Add temporary state (will be discarded)
    }

    # --- Create Event with Actions ---
    actions_with_update = EventActions(state_delta=state_changes)
    # This event might represent an internal system action, not just an agent response
    system_event = Event(
        invocation_id="inv_login_update",
        author="system", # Or 'agent', 'tool' etc.
        actions=actions_with_update,
        timestamp=current_time
        # content might be None or represent the action taken
    )

    # --- Append the Event (This updates the state) ---
    await session_service.append_event(session, system_event)
    print("`append_event` called with explicit state delta.")

    # --- Check Updated State ---
    updated_session = await session_service.get_session(app_name=app_name,
                                                user_id=user_id,
                                                session_id=session_id)
    print(f"State after event: {updated_session.state}")
    # Expected: {'user:login_count': 1, 'task_status': 'active', 'user:last_login_ts': <timestamp>}
    # Note: 'temp:validation_needed' is NOT present.
    ```

=== "Java"

    ```java
    --8<-- "examples/java/snippets/src/main/java/state/ManualStateUpdateExample.java:full_code"
    ```

**3. Via `CallbackContext` or `ToolContext` (Recommended for Callbacks and Tools)**

Modifying state within agent callbacks (e.g., `on_before_agent_call`, `on_after_agent_call`) or tool functions is best done using the `state` attribute of the `CallbackContext` or `ToolContext` provided to your function.

*   `callback_context.state['my_key'] = my_value`
*   `tool_context.state['my_key'] = my_value`

These context objects are specifically designed to manage state changes within their respective execution scopes. When you modify `context.state`, the ADK framework ensures that these changes are automatically captured and correctly routed into the `EventActions.state_delta` for the event being generated by the callback or tool. This delta is then processed by the `SessionService` when the event is appended, ensuring proper persistence and tracking.

This method abstracts away the manual creation of `EventActions` and `state_delta` for most common state update scenarios within callbacks and tools, making your code cleaner and less error-prone.

For more comprehensive details on context objects, refer to the [Context documentation](../context/index.md).

=== "Python"

    ```python
    # In an agent callback or tool function
    from google.adk.agents import CallbackContext # or ToolContext

    def my_callback_or_tool_function(context: CallbackContext, # Or ToolContext
                                     # ... other parameters ...
                                    ):
        # Update existing state
        count = context.state.get("user_action_count", 0)
        context.state["user_action_count"] = count + 1

        # Add new state
        context.state["temp:last_operation_status"] = "success"

        # State changes are automatically part of the event's state_delta
        # ... rest of callback/tool logic ...
    ```

=== "Java"

    ```java
    // In an agent callback or tool method
    import com.google.adk.agents.CallbackContext; // or ToolContext
    // ... other imports ...

    public class MyAgentCallbacks {
        public void onAfterAgent(CallbackContext callbackContext) {
            // Update existing state
            Integer count = (Integer) callbackContext.state().getOrDefault("user_action_count", 0);
            callbackContext.state().put("user_action_count", count + 1);

            // Add new state
            callbackContext.state().put("temp:last_operation_status", "success");

            // State changes are automatically part of the event's state_delta
            // ... rest of callback logic ...
        }
    }
    ```

**What `append_event` Does:**

* Adds the `Event` to `session.events`.
* Reads the `state_delta` from the event's `actions`.
* Applies these changes to the state managed by the `SessionService`, correctly handling prefixes and persistence based on the service type.
* Updates the session's `last_update_time`.
* Ensures thread-safety for concurrent updates.

### ⚠️ A Warning About Direct State Modification

Avoid directly modifying the `session.state` collection (dictionary/Map) on a `Session` object that was obtained directly from the `SessionService` (e.g., via `session_service.get_session()` or `session_service.create_session()`) *outside* of the managed lifecycle of an agent invocation (i.e., not through a `CallbackContext` or `ToolContext`). For example, code like `retrieved_session = await session_service.get_session(...); retrieved_session.state['key'] = value` is problematic.

State modifications *within* callbacks or tools using `CallbackContext.state` or `ToolContext.state` are the correct way to ensure changes are tracked, as these context objects handle the necessary integration with the event system.

**Why direct modification (outside of contexts) is strongly discouraged:**

1. **Bypasses Event History:** The change isn't recorded as an `Event`, losing auditability.
2. **Breaks Persistence:** Changes made this way **will likely NOT be saved** by `DatabaseSessionService` or `VertexAiSessionService`. They rely on `append_event` to trigger saving.
3. **Not Thread-Safe:** Can lead to race conditions and lost updates.
4. **Ignores Timestamps/Logic:** Doesn't update `last_update_time` or trigger related event logic.

**Recommendation:** Stick to updating state via `output_key`, `EventActions.state_delta` (when manually creating events), or by modifying the `state` property of `CallbackContext` or `ToolContext` objects when within their respective scopes. These methods ensure reliable, trackable, and persistent state management. Use direct access to `session.state` (from a `SessionService`-retrieved session) only for *reading* state.

### Best Practices for State Design Recap

* **Minimalism:** Store only essential, dynamic data.
* **Serialization:** Use basic, serializable types.
* **Descriptive Keys & Prefixes:** Use clear names and appropriate prefixes (`user:`, `app:`, `temp:`, or none).
* **Shallow Structures:** Avoid deep nesting where possible.
* **Standard Update Flow:** Rely on `append_event`.
