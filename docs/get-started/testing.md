# Testing your Agents

Before you deploy your agent, you should test it to ensure that it is working as
intended. The easiest way to test your agent in your development environment is
to use the ADK API server.

=== "Python"

    ```py
    adk api_server
    ```

=== "Java"

    Make sure to update the port number.

    ```java
    mvn compile exec:java \
         -Dexec.args="--adk.agents.source-dir=src/main/java/agents --server.port=8080"
    ```
    In Java, both the Dev UI and the API server are bundled together.

This command will launch a local web server, where you can run cURL commands or send API requests to test your agent.

!!! tip "Advanced Usage and Debugging"

    For a complete reference on all available endpoints, request/response formats, and tips for debugging (including how to use the interactive API documentation), see the **ADK API Server Guide** below.

## Local testing

Local testing involves launching a local web server, creating a session, and
sending queries to your agent. First, ensure you are in the correct working
directory:

```console
parent_folder/
└── my_sample_agent/
    └── agent.py (or Agent.java)
```

**Launch the Local Server**

Next, launch the local server using the commands listed above.

The output should appear similar to:

=== "Python"

    ```shell
    INFO:     Started server process [12345]
    INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
    INFO:     Application startup complete.
    INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://localhost:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
    ```

=== "Java"

    ```shell
    2025-05-13T23:32:08.972-06:00  INFO 37864 --- [ebServer.main()] o.s.b.w.embedded.tomcat.TomcatWebServer  : Tomcat started on port 8080 (http) with context path '/'
    2025-05-13T23:32:08.980-06:00  INFO 37864 --- [ebServer.main()] com.google.adk.web.AdkWebServer          : Started AdkWebServer in 1.15 seconds (process running for 2.877)
    2025-05-13T23:32:08.981-06:00  INFO 37864 --- [ebServer.main()] com.google.adk.web.AdkWebServer          : AdkWebServer application started successfully.
    ```

Your server is now running locally. Ensure you use the correct **_port number_** in all the subsequent commands.

**Create a new session**

With the API server still running, open a new terminal window or tab and create
a new session with the agent using:

```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/apps/my_sample_agent/users/u_123/sessions/s_123 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"state": {"key1": "value1", "key2": 42}}'
```

Let's break down what's happening:

* `http://localhost:8000/apps/my_sample_agent/users/u_123/sessions/s_123`: This
  creates a new session for your agent `my_sample_agent`, which is the name of
  the agent folder, for a user ID (`u_123`) and for a session ID (`s_123`). You
  can replace `my_sample_agent` with the name of your agent folder. You can
  replace `u_123` with a specific user ID, and `s_123` with a specific session
  ID.
* `{"state": {"key1": "value1", "key2": 42}}`: This is optional. You can use
  this to customize the agent's pre-existing state (dict) when creating the
  session.

This should return the session information if it was created successfully. The
output should appear similar to:

```json
{"id":"s_123","appName":"my_sample_agent","userId":"u_123","state":{"key1":"value1","key2":42},"events":[],"lastUpdateTime":1743711430.022186}
```

!!! info

    You cannot create multiple sessions with exactly the same user ID and
    session ID. If you try to, you may see a response, like:
    `{"detail":"Session already exists: s_123"}`. To fix this, you can either
    delete that session (e.g., `s_123`), or choose a different session ID.

**Send a query**

There are two ways to send queries via POST to your agent, via the `/run` or
`/run_sse` routes.

* `POST http://localhost:8000/run`: collects all events as a list and returns the
  list all at once. Suitable for most users (if you are unsure, we recommend
  using this one).
* `POST http://localhost:8000/run_sse`: returns as Server-Sent-Events, which is a
  stream of event objects. Suitable for those who want to be notified as soon as
  the event is available. With `/run_sse`, you can also set `streaming` to
  `true` to enable token-level streaming.

**Using `/run`**

```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/run \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
"app_name": "my_sample_agent",
"user_id": "u_123",
"session_id": "s_123",
"new_message": {
    "role": "user",
    "parts": [{
    "text": "Hey whats the weather in new york today"
    }]
}
}'
```

If using `/run`, you will see the full output of events at the same time, as a
list, which should appear similar to:

```json
[{"content":{"parts":[{"functionCall":{"id":"af-e75e946d-c02a-4aad-931e-49e4ab859838","args":{"city":"new york"},"name":"get_weather"}}],"role":"model"},"invocationId":"e-71353f1e-aea1-4821-aa4b-46874a766853","author":"weather_time_agent","actions":{"stateDelta":{},"artifactDelta":{},"requestedAuthConfigs":{}},"longRunningToolIds":[],"id":"2Btee6zW","timestamp":1743712220.385936},{"content":{"parts":[{"functionResponse":{"id":"af-e75e946d-c02a-4aad-931e-49e4ab859838","name":"get_weather","response":{"status":"success","report":"The weather in New York is sunny with a temperature of 25 degrees Celsius (41 degrees Fahrenheit)."}}}],"role":"user"},"invocationId":"e-71353f1e-aea1-4821-aa4b-46874a766853","author":"weather_time_agent","actions":{"stateDelta":{},"artifactDelta":{},"requestedAuthConfigs":{}},"id":"PmWibL2m","timestamp":1743712221.895042},{"content":{"parts":[{"text":"OK. The weather in New York is sunny with a temperature of 25 degrees Celsius (41 degrees Fahrenheit).\n"}],"role":"model"},"invocationId":"e-71353f1e-aea1-4821-aa4b-46874a766853","author":"weather_time_agent","actions":{"stateDelta":{},"artifactDelta":{},"requestedAuthConfigs":{}},"id":"sYT42eVC","timestamp":1743712221.899018}]
```

**Using `/run_sse`**

```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/run_sse \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
"app_name": "my_sample_agent",
"user_id": "u_123",
"session_id": "s_123",
"new_message": {
    "role": "user",
    "parts": [{
    "text": "Hey whats the weather in new york today"
    }]
},
"streaming": false
}'
```

You can set `streaming` to `true` to enable token-level streaming, which means
the response will be returned to you in multiple chunks and the output should
appear similar to:


```shell
data: {"content":{"parts":[{"functionCall":{"id":"af-f83f8af9-f732-46b6-8cb5-7b5b73bbf13d","args":{"city":"new york"},"name":"get_weather"}}],"role":"model"},"invocationId":"e-3f6d7765-5287-419e-9991-5fffa1a75565","author":"weather_time_agent","actions":{"stateDelta":{},"artifactDelta":{},"requestedAuthConfigs":{}},"longRunningToolIds":[],"id":"ptcjaZBa","timestamp":1743712255.313043}

data: {"content":{"parts":[{"functionResponse":{"id":"af-f83f8af9-f732-46b6-8cb5-7b5b73bbf13d","name":"get_weather","response":{"status":"success","report":"The weather in New York is sunny with a temperature of 25 degrees Celsius (41 degrees Fahrenheit)."}}}],"role":"user"},"invocationId":"e-3f6d7765-5287-419e-9991-5fffa1a75565","author":"weather_time_agent","actions":{"stateDelta":{},"artifactDelta":{},"requestedAuthConfigs":{}},"id":"5aocxjaq","timestamp":1743712257.387306}

data: {"content":{"parts":[{"text":"OK. The weather in New York is sunny with a temperature of 25 degrees Celsius (41 degrees Fahrenheit).\n"}],"role":"model"},"invocationId":"e-3f6d7765-5287-419e-9991-5fffa1a75565","author":"weather_time_agent","actions":{"stateDelta":{},"artifactDelta":{},"requestedAuthConfigs":{}},"id":"rAnWGSiV","timestamp":1743712257.391317}
```

!!! info

    If you are using `/run_sse`, you should see each event as soon as it becomes
    available.

## Integrations

ADK uses [Callbacks](../callbacks/index.md) to integrate with third-party
observability tools. These integrations capture detailed traces of agent calls
and interactions, which are crucial for understanding behavior, debugging
issues, and evaluating performance.

* [Comet Opik](https://github.com/comet-ml/opik) is an open-source LLM
  observability and evaluation platform that
  [natively supports ADK](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/tracing/integrations/adk).

## Deploying your agent

Now that you've verified the local operation of your agent, you're ready to move
on to deploying your agent! Here are some ways you can deploy your agent:

* Deploy to [Agent Engine](../deploy/agent-engine.md), the easiest way to deploy
  your ADK agents to a managed service in Vertex AI on Google Cloud.
* Deploy to [Cloud Run](../deploy/cloud-run.md) and have full control over how
  you scale and manage your agents using serverless architecture on Google
  Cloud.


## The ADK API Server

The ADK API Server is a pre-packaged [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) web server that exposes your agents through a RESTful API. It is the primary tool for local testing and development, allowing you to interact with your agents programmatically before deploying them.

## Running the Server

To start the server, run the following command from your project's root directory:

```shell
adk api_server
```

By default, the server runs on `http://localhost:8000`. You will see output confirming that the server has started:

```shell
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://localhost:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

## Debugging with Interactive API Docs

The API server automatically generates interactive API documentation using Swagger UI. This is an invaluable tool for exploring endpoints, understanding request formats, and testing your agent directly from your browser.

To access the interactive docs, start the API server and navigate to [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs) in your web browser.

You will see a complete, interactive list of all available API endpoints, which you can expand to see detailed information about parameters, request bodies, and response schemas. You can even click "Try it out" to send live requests to your running agents.

## API Endpoints

The following sections detail the primary endpoints for interacting with your agents.

!!! note "JSON Naming Convention"
    - **Request bodies** must use `snake_case` for field names (e.g., `"app_name"`).
    - **Response bodies** will use `camelCase` for field names (e.g., `"appName"`).

### Utility Endpoints

#### List Available Agents

Returns a list of all agent applications discovered by the server.

*   **Method:** `GET`
*   **Path:** `/list-apps`

**Example Request**
```shell
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/list-apps
```

**Example Response**
```json
["my_sample_agent", "another_agent"]
```

---

### Session Management

Sessions store the state and event history for a specific user's interaction with an agent.

#### Create or Update a Session

Creates a new session or updates an existing one. If a session with the given IDs already exists, its state will be overwritten with the new state provided.

*   **Method:** `POST`
*   **Path:** `/apps/{app_name}/users/{user_id}/sessions/{session_id}`

**Request Body**
```json
{
  "state": {
    "key1": "value1",
    "key2": 42
  }
}
```

**Example Request**
```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/apps/my_sample_agent/users/u_123/sessions/s_abc \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"state": {"visit_count": 5}}'
```

**Example Response**
```json
{"id":"s_abc","appName":"my_sample_agent","userId":"u_123","state":{"visit_count":5},"events":[],"lastUpdateTime":1743711430.022186}
```

#### Get a Session

Retrieves the details of a specific session, including its current state and all associated events.

*   **Method:** `GET`
*   **Path:** `/apps/{app_name}/users/{user_id}/sessions/{session_id}`

**Example Request**
```shell
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/apps/my_sample_agent/users/u_123/sessions/s_abc
```

**Example Response**
```json
{"id":"s_abc","appName":"my_sample_agent","userId":"u_123","state":{"visit_count":5},"events":[...],"lastUpdateTime":1743711430.022186}
```

#### Delete a Session

Deletes a session and all of its associated data.

*   **Method:** `DELETE`
*   **Path:** `/apps/{app_name}/users/{user_id}/sessions/{session_id}`

**Example Request**
```shell
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8000/apps/my_sample_agent/users/u_123/sessions/s_abc
```

**Example Response**
A successful deletion returns an empty response with a `204 No Content` status code.

---

### Agent Execution

These endpoints are used to send a new message to an agent and get a response.

#### Run Agent (Single Response)

Executes the agent and returns all generated events in a single JSON array after the run is complete.

*   **Method:** `POST`
*   **Path:** `/run`

**Request Body**
```json
{
  "app_name": "my_sample_agent",
  "user_id": "u_123",
  "session_id": "s_abc",
  "new_message": {
    "role": "user",
    "parts": [
      { "text": "What is the capital of France?" }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Example Request**
```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/run \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "app_name": "my_sample_agent",
    "user_id": "u_123",
    "session_id": "s_abc",
    "new_message": {
      "role": "user",
      "parts": [{"text": "What is the capital of France?"}]
    }
  }'
```

#### Run Agent (Streaming)

Executes the agent and streams events back to the client as they are generated using [Server-Sent Events (SSE)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events).

*   **Method:** `POST`
*   **Path:** `/run_sse`

**Request Body**
The request body is the same as for `/run`, with an additional optional `streaming` flag.
```json
{
  "app_name": "my_sample_agent",
  "user_id": "u_123",
  "session_id": "s_abc",
  "new_message": {
    "role": "user",
    "parts": [
      { "text": "What is the weather in New York?" }
    ]
  },
  "streaming": true
}
```
- `streaming`: (Optional) Set to `true` to enable token-level streaming for model responses. Defaults to `false`.

**Example Request**
```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/run_sse \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "app_name": "my_sample_agent",
    "user_id": "u_123",
    "session_id": "s_abc",
    "new_message": {
      "role": "user",
      "parts": [{"text": "What is the weather in New York?"}]
    },
    "streaming": false
  }'
```
