# ADK with Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol

With Agent Development Kit (ADK), you can build complex multi-agent systems where different agents need to collaborate and interact using [Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol](https://a2a-protocol.org/)! This section provides a comprehensive guide to building powerful multi-agent systems where agents can communicate and collaborate securely and efficiently.

Navigate through the guides below to learn about ADK's A2A capabilities:

  **[Introduction to A2A](./intro.md)**

  Start here to learn the fundamentals of A2A by building a multi-agent system with a root agent, a local sub-agent, and a remote A2A agent.

  **[A2A Quickstart (Exposing)](./quickstart-exposing.md)**

  This quickstart covers: **"I have an agent. How do I expose it so that other agents can use my agent via A2A?"**.

  **[A2A Quickstart (Consuming)](./quickstart-consuming.md)**

  This quickstart covers: **"There is a remote agent, how do I let my ADK agent use it via A2A?"**.
