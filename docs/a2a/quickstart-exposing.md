# Quickstart: Exposing a remote agent via A2A

This quickstart covers the most common starting point for any developer: **"I have an agent. How do I expose it so that other agents can use my agent via A2A?"**. This is crucial for building complex multi-agent systems where different agents need to collaborate and interact.

## Overview

This sample demonstrates how you can easily expose an ADK agent so that it can be then consumed by another agent using the A2A Protocol.

There are two main ways to expose an ADK agent via A2A.

* **by using the `to_a2a(root_agent)` function**: use this function if you just want to convert an existing agent to work with A2A, and be able to expose it via a server through `uvicorn`, instead of `adk deploy api_server`. This means that you have tighter control over what you want to expose via `uvicorn` when you want to productionize your agent. Furthermore, the `to_a2a()` function auto-generates an agent card based on your agent code.
* **by creating your own agent card (`agent.json`) and hosting it using `adk api_server --a2a`**: There are two main benefits of using this approach. First, `adk api_server --a2a` works with `adk web`, making it easy to use, debug, and test your agent. Second, with `adk api_server`, you can specify a parent folder with multiple, separate agents. Those agents that have an agent card (`agent.json`), will automatically be usable via A2A by other agents through the same server. However, you will need to create your own agent cards. To create an agent card, you can follow the [A2A Python tutorial](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/tutorials/python/1-introduction/).

This quickstart will focus on `to_a2a()`, as it is the easiest way to expose your agent and will also autogenerate the agent card behind-the-scenes. If you'd like to use the `adk api_server` approach, you can see it being used in the [A2A Quickstart (Consuming) documentation](quickstart-consuming.md).

                                                          ▼

└────────────────┘
```

The sample consists of :

- **Remote Hello World Agent** (`remote_a2a/hello_world/agent.py`): This is the agent that you want to expose so that other agents can use it via A2A. It is an agent that handles dice rolling and prime number checking. It becomes exposed using the `to_a2a()` function and is served using `uvicorn`.
- **Root Agent** (`agent.py`): A simple agent that is just calling the remote Hello World agent.

## Exposing the Remote Agent with the `to_a2a(root_agent)` function

You can take an existing agent built using ADK and make it A2A-compatible by simply wrapping it using the `to_a2a()` function. For example, if you have an agent like the following defined in `root_agent`:

```python
# Your agent code here
root_agent = Agent(
    model='gemini-2.0-flash',
    name='hello_world_agent',
    
    <...your agent code...>
)
```

Then you can make it A2A-compatible simply by using `to_a2a(root_agent)`:

```python
from google.adk.a2a.utils.agent_to_a2a import to_a2a

# Make your agent A2A-compatible
a2a_app = to_a2a(root_agent, port=8001)
```

By default, the `to_a2a()` function will auto-generate an agent card in-memory behind-the-scenes by [extracting skills, capabilities, and metadata from the ADK agent](https://github.com/google/adk-python/blob/main/src/google/adk/a2a/utils/agent_card_builder.py), so that the well-known agent card is made available when the agent endpoint is served using `uvicorn`. However, you can also provide your own agent card.

<br>
To have more control over the generated agent card, you can provide your own `agent_card` when calling `to_a2a()`. The `agent_card` can either be an `AgentCard` object or a path to an agent card JSON file.

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from google.adk.a2a.utils.agent_to_a2a import to_a2a
    from a2a.types import AgentCard

    # Example 1: Using a pre-built AgentCard object
    my_custom_agent_card = AgentCard(
        name="my_custom_agent",
        description="A custom agent with specific skills.",
        # ... other agent card fields
    )
    a2a_app_custom = to_a2a(root_agent, agent_card=my_custom_agent_card, port=8002)

    # Example 2: Using a path to an agent card JSON file
    a2a_app_from_file = to_a2a(root_agent, agent_card="/path/to/my/agent_card.json", port=8003)
    ```

Now let's dive into the sample code.

### 1. Getting the Sample Code { #getting-the-sample-code }

First, make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install google-adk[a2a]
```

You can clone and navigate to the [**a2a_root** sample](https://github.com/google/adk-python/tree/main/contributing/samples/a2a_root) here:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/google/adk-python.git
```

As you'll see, the folder structure is as follows:

```text
a2a_root/
├── remote_a2a/
│   └── hello_world/    
│       ├── __init__.py
│       └── agent.py    # Remote Hello World Agent
├── README.md
└── agent.py            # Root agent
```

#### Root Agent (`a2a_root/agent.py`)

- **`root_agent`**: A `RemoteA2aAgent` that connects to the remote A2A service
- **Agent Card URL**: Points to the well-known agent card endpoint on the remote server

#### Remote Hello World Agent (`a2a_root/remote_a2a/hello_world/agent.py`)

- **`roll_die(sides: int)`**: Function tool for rolling dice with state management
- **`check_prime(nums: list[int])`**: Async function for prime number checking
- **`root_agent`**: The main agent with comprehensive instructions
- **`a2a_app`**: The A2A application created using `to_a2a()` utility

### 2. Start the Remote A2A Agent server { #start-the-remote-a2a-agent-server }

You can now start the remote agent server, which will host the `a2a_app` within the hello_world agent:

```bash
# Ensure current working directory is adk-python/
# Start the remote agent using uvicorn
uvicorn contributing.samples.a2a_root.remote_a2a.hello_world.agent:a2a_app --host localhost --port 8001
```

??? note "Why use port 8001?"
    In this quickstart, when testing locally, your agents will be using localhost, so the `port` for the A2A server for the exposed agent (the remote, prime agent) must be different from the consuming agent's port. The default port for `adk web` where you will interact with the consuming agent is `8000`, which is why the A2A server is created using a separate port, `8001`.

Once executed, you should see something like:

```shell
INFO:     Started server process [10615]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://localhost:8001 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

### 3. Check that your remote agent is running { #check-that-your-remote-agent-is-running }

You can check that your agent is up and running by visiting the agent card that was auto-generated earlier as part of your `to_a2a()` function in `a2a_root/remote_a2a/hello_world/agent.py`:

[http://localhost:8001/.well-known/agent.json](http://localhost:8001/.well-known/agent.json)

You should see the contents of the agent card, which should look like:

```json
{"capabilities":{},"defaultInputModes":["text/plain"],"defaultOutputModes":["text/plain"],"description":"hello world agent that can roll a dice of 8 sides and check prime numbers.","name":"hello_world_agent","protocolVersion":"0.2.6","skills":[{"description":"hello world agent that can roll a dice of 8 sides and check prime numbers. \n      I roll dice and answer questions about the outcome of the dice rolls.\n      I can roll dice of different sizes.\n      I can use multiple tools in parallel by calling functions in parallel(in one request and in one round).\n      It is ok to discuss previous dice roles, and comment on the dice rolls.\n      When I are asked to roll a die, I must call the roll_die tool with the number of sides.

```

### 4. Run the Main (Consuming) Agent { #run-the-main-consuming-agent }

Now that your remote agent is running, you can launch the dev UI and select "a2a_root" as your agent.

```bash
# In a separate terminal, run the adk web server
adk web contributing/samples/
```

To open the adk web server, go to: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

## Example Interactions

Once both services are running, you can interact with the root agent to see how it calls the remote agent via A2A:

**Simple Dice Rolling:**
This interaction uses a local agent, the Roll Agent:

```text
User: Roll a 6-sided die
Bot: I rolled a 4 for you.
```

**Prime Number Checking:**

This interaction uses a remote agent via A2A, the Prime Agent:

```text
User: Is 7 a prime number?
Bot: Yes, 7 is a prime number.
```

**Combined Operations:**

This interaction uses both the local Roll Agent and the remote Prime Agent:

```text
User: Roll a 10-sided die and check if it's prime
Bot: I rolled an 8 for you.
Bot: 8 is not a prime number.
```

## Next Steps

Now that you have created an agent that's exposing a remote agent via an A2A server, the next step is to learn how to consume it from another agent.
