# Code Executors

ADK's Code Executors empower agents to execute code, a powerful capability for a wide range of applications.

## BaseCodeExecutor

The `BaseCodeExecutor` is the abstract base class for all code executors. Its core method is `execute_code`, which takes code as input and returns the execution result.

## Built-in Code Executors

ADK provides several built-in code executors:

### `BuiltInCodeExecutor`

This executor leverages the model's native code execution capabilities. It's currently supported for Gemini 2.0+ models.

### `UnsafeLocalCodeExecutor`

This executor runs code directly on the local machine. As the name suggests, it is **unsafe** and should only be used in secure and trusted environments. It is not stateful and does not support data file optimization.

### `VertexAiCodeExecutor`

For a more secure and scalable solution, the `VertexAiCodeExecutor` uses the Vertex AI Code Interpreter Extension. It supports stateful execution and can handle input and output files, making it suitable for complex data analysis tasks.

## How to use Code Executors

To enable code execution for an agent, set the `code_executor` attribute on your `LlmAgent`:

```python
from google.adk.agents.llm_agent import LlmAgent
from google.adk.code_executors.vertex_ai_code_executor import VertexAiCodeExecutor

agent = LlmAgent(
    ...
    code_executor=VertexAiCodeExecutor(),
    ...
)
```

## Security Considerations

Executing code generated by an LLM carries inherent security risks. It's crucial to choose the right code executor for your use case. For production systems, we strongly recommend using the `VertexAiCodeExecutor` or creating a custom executor with appropriate sandboxing and security measures in place.
